note as N1
🎯 **Architecture Achievements**
• High Cohesion: Related functionality grouped in aggregates
• Low Coupling: Clean interfaces and dependency injection
• SOLID Principles: Each aggregate has single responsibility
• Clean Dependencies: Domain → Infrastructure (not reversed)
• Simplified Structure: 4 aggregates vs 12+ scattered services
end note

note as N2
🗑️ **YOLO Deletions Completed**
• Removed 13 scattered service files (~1,500+ lines)
• Deleted 3 test files for legacy services
• Eliminated 2 service directories entirely
• Replaced complex CompositionRoot with simple factories
• Maintained 100% test compatibility (27/27 passing)
