## Key Messaging Changes

### Before (Complex):
- "Content-aware styling with multiple personas"
- "Voice personas for different content types"
- "Document type drives speech patterns"

### After (Simplified):
- "Single consistent voice throughout document"
- "Natural speech without artificial style switching"
- "Minimal shared services for code reuse without over-engineering"

## Impact

The documentation now accurately reflects:
- ✅ Simplified, maintainable TTS architecture
- ✅ Clear separation between shared utilities and engine-specific logic
- ✅ Natural voice delivery approach
- ✅ Future-ready architecture for adding new engines
- ✅ Reduced complexity without sacrificing functionality
