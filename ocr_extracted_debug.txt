1 INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, the human-computer interaction (HCI) literature has seen a growing in-
terest in technology-enabled interventions to support emotion regulation [3–5, 23, 61, 88]. This
rapid growth is fuelled by several factors, including an increased interest in the possibilities of
technology-supportinthecontextofmentalhealth[41,62,80,98],theproliferationoflow-cost
wearablesensorsenablingpotentiallywidelydeployablebio-feedbacksystems(e.g.,[4,75]),and
the associated focus on combining affective computing and personal informatics agendas (e.g.,
emotionawarenesssystems[7,42])—seealso[29,80]fortworecentreviews.Anevenmoredra-
maticexplosionofinterestinemotionregulationishappeningoutsideofHCI.Researchconcerning

Indeed,inrecentyears,emotionregulationhasbeguntobeseenasalikelytrans-diagnosticinter-

Sofar,however,thepotentialtocombinetheinnovativeHCIinterventionapproachesandstate-

In this article, we aim to take stock of the HCI work on emotion regulation so far, synthesise
and make accessible the breadth of existing work on emotion regulation in psychology, as well
as suggest promising directions for future research on technology-enabled emotion regulation
interventionsthattheHCIcommunitycanengageinasthefieldmatures.

In the rest of the article, we encapsulate the synthesis of current—and potential future—HCI
work on emotion regulation interventions in a three-part framework (see Figure 1), aiming to
help technology designers separate out decisions on three inter-related aspects of intervention
development:
(1) Theory-informed decisions about intervention targets from psychology: i.e., ‘what’ are the

TheoryPartSummary(Section2)
Psychologyliteratureprovidesausefulsetoftheory-driveninterventiontargets:i.e.,welldefined
conceptual processes that technology-enabled interventions could aim to affect. We highlight
Gross’ProcessModelofEmotionRegulation[38],whichallowsdesignerstothinksystematically
about how emotions are generated from ‘person-situation’ interactions, the approaches users might
taketoimpacttheiremotions,andprovidesasetofclearinterventionpointstotarget.
Inparticular,theProcessModeldifferentiatestheintertwinedprocessesofemotiongeneration
and emotion regulation. Emotion generation is a result of: people encountering, consciously or
subconsciously attending to, evaluating, and responding to internal (e.g., a memory/thought) or
external (e.g., workplace disagreement) situations. In contrast, emotion regulation occurs when
peopleevaluatetheircurrentemotionalstaterelativetotheirgoalsanddecidetomodifythem(or
not).Specifically:
—The process of emotion regulation is seen as proceeding in four stages: identification (of
theneedtoregulateone’semotion),strategyselection(fromthefivefamiliesbelow),imple-
mentation(ofaparticularinstanceofastrategywithinthecurrentcontext),andmonitoring
(whethertocontinue,stop,orchangeERstrategy).
—ThefivefamiliesofspecificERstrategiesthensynthesisethecommonapproachesthatpeo-

Another important implication from the psychological literature is that learning to regulate

The strategic component of the proposed framework thus aims at helping guide designers in
decidinghow,when,andwheretheinterventionsupport couldbemosteffectivelyofferedthrough
technology.Inparticular,webasethestrategycomponentsonlearningsciencesliteraturetoen-
courage HCI designers to think about delivery mechanisms in the context of their role in the

approachesfromexistingtherapieswithlimitedadditionaltechnologysupport).
—For the ‘whens/wheres’, the offline design components aim to use interactivity to create a
bespokeemotionregulationloop(e.g.,usingavideogametoelicitfeelingsofstresswhile,at
thesametime,providingothersupportsuchasabiofeedbacklooptodown-regulatethose
feelings);tofacilitaterelaxationtrainingsupport (similartoabovebutwithouttheemotion

users’ in-the-moment emotion regulation process), and can offer either single-point (e.g.,
reminder)orongoingsupport(e.g.,hapticfeedbackthroughoutastressfulexperience).
How are These Combined into Interventions? When looking at how these intervention design
components are combined into final systems the existing work clearly clusters into three main
researchareas,asoutlinedbelow.
—impliciton-the-spotsupport (e.g.,providingatargetbreathingratethroughhapticinput;ex-
periential+on-the-spot);
—bio-feedback games (e.g,. embedding a biofeedback component into stressful gaming as a
visualoverlay;experiential+offline);and
—reminder-recommenders & awareness systems (e.g., push notifications suggesting ER strate-
gies;didactic+on-the-spot).
Interestingly, these approaches are mostly independent from each other as they draw on dif-
ferent background literature, intervention goals, and technological components. This clustering

Overall,theseobservationssuggestthattheworksofarhasbeenfragmentedalongtechnology-

2 THEORYCOMPONENT—EMOTIONREGULATIONMODELS(THE‘WHATS’)
Emotionregulationisbroadlydefinedas‘thesetofstrategiesthatindividualsmayusetoincrease,
maintain or decrease their affective experience, including the feelings, behaviours or physiological
responses thatmake up a given emotion[37]’. The purposeof thissection is not to provide a full
reviewofallthatisknownaboutemotionregulation,asthatissimplyinfeasiblegiventheincred-
iblegrowthoftheliteratureofthelasttwodecades;see[19,28,50,82,85,90]forrecentreviews.
Instead, we aim to synthesise key aspects of the most widely cited1 emotion regulation model—
Gross’ Process Model of Emotion regulation [36]—especially insofar as these can be generative
for the design of emotion regulation technologies and help prepare ground for the psychology-
informedmappingofexistingHCIsystemsinthenextsection.

This model is useful because it describes five families of ER strategies that people can use to
regulate emotion based on when in the cycle they intervene in the emotion generation process
(seeSection2.2).Withineachfamily,strategiescanbeadaptiveormal-adaptivewithinthespecific

For example, difficulties in identification would relate to lack of emotional awareness and/or

ornotbeingawareoftheneedtoemotionregulate(suchasnotbeingawarethatoneislashing

whether this is due to habitual selection of maladaptive approaches (such as suppression) or to
the lack of knowledge of alternative strategies (e.g., unaware of cognitive reappraisal). Difficul-
ties in implementation can comprise lack of ability to execute a selected tactic successfully (e.g.,

and [82], we now briefly describe each of the families of strategies using the definitions and ex-
amples from prior work for clarity, as well as positioning some of the best established emotion
regulationstrategieswithineachofthefamilies(cf.,[1]).
—Situation selection includes efforts to change the full emotional experience at the earliest
stage,suchasnotchoosingtoengagesituationsthatmightinduceunwantedemotions.Ex-
amplesincludeavoidingameanco-worker,orarrangingtoseeanupliftingmovie,orchoos-
ing to scroll on one’s phone rather than engaging with others at a party. One commonly
usedstrategyforsituationselectionisavoidancewherethepersonischoosingashort-term
relief through avoiding potentially emotionally risky activities (such as never disagreeing
with colleagues due to fear of dealing with conflicts). If used excessively, however, avoid-
ance is seen as an example of a mal-adaptive emotion regulation strategy, with long-term
costsoutweighingtheshort-termbenefits.
—Situation modification refers to attempting to change external features of a situation, with
the goal of changing its emotional impact. Examples include filing away a rejection letter
ratherthankeepingitfullyinview,orshorteningthetimespentwithacolleaguewhomakes
youuncomfortable,orblockingatoxiccontactonTwitter.Acommonsituationmodification
strategyoftenpresentacrossarangeofinterventionsisproblemsolving,whichisseenasa
consciousefforttochangeastressfulsituationorcontainitsconsequences.
—Attentional deployment moves from trying to modify external features of the situation to
modifying early information processing that relies on attention. One common strategy is
distraction,whichredirectsattentionwithinagivensituation(suchasfocusingonaneutral
ratherthanemotion-elicitingaspectofamoviescene),orshiftinginternalfocusawayfrom

—Incontrast,cognitivechangereferstomodifyingone’sownappraisalofthesituationinorder

cognitivechangetargetsaninternalsituation(e.g.,‘Myracingheartisnotasignofpanic,

tiallyemotion-elicitingsituation(“Thiseventdoesn’tdirectlyinvolvemeoranyoneIlove.”).
Another well-known strategy is non-judgemental acceptance of emotional states, which is
based on a present-centred awareness in which thoughts, feelings, and sensations are ac-
cepted as they are. Acceptance is often hypothesised as a core component of mindfulness
interventions(see,forexample,[32]).
—Finally,responsemodulationreferstodirectlyinfluencingexperiential,behavioural,orphys-
iological components of the emotional response after the emotion is well developed. Ex-
amples include using alcohol, cigarettes or drugs to alter emotional state, or relying on
deep breathing and exercise to change one’s physiological responses. A particularly well-
researchedstrategyinthiscategoryissuppressionwhichreferstoongoingeffortstoinhibit

insofar as it is aimed at altering a bodily response to a particular person-situation context; it is
performative. On the other hand, a substantial part of how such nonsymbolic goal is achieved
reliesoncognitiveprocesses—includingversionsofcognitivechange(e.g.,re-appraisal),explicit
attentional deployment, or acceptance—which are often symbolic (using words to re-frame our

Existing design challenges. There are two key challenges to body-based emotion regulation
models used in ER interventions. One challenge is that experiential or embodied skills develop-
ment focuses on learning to be aware of, attentive to and able to modify different physiological
and neurological processes. Since these processes are internal body states, they are not easily

perceived nor articulated and are not directly observable to an external party (e.g., therapist),
making real-time, accurate external feedback and/or self-reflection both difficult and highly
subjective; it is often difficult for learners to know when they are ‘getting it right’. The other
challenge is—again—the lack of support to help learners transfer trained skills into everyday
life.Mostinterventionsinvolveahomeworkstylecomponentinwhichtheclientpracticeswhat
they have learned in sessions, however there is still a gap related to support for learners to
transfer embodied skills, such as mindful nonjudgmental attention or interoceptive awareness,

thus highlight an analogous difference between offline vs on-the-spot intervention supports as

4.1 ScopingReviewMethodology
We conducted a literature review that targeted full articles and notes as well as high quality
works-in-progress that were published in top venues in HCI. We targeted the ACM digital li-
brary, IEEE databases and used Google Scholar to search for articles published between Janu-
ary12009andDecember82021.Ourkeywordsearchcriteriawere“interactivetechnology”and
oneormoreof ‘emotionregulation’or‘self-regulation’or‘stress’or‘stress-regulation’.Theini-
tial search resulted in 5,574 articles, out of which 36 articles fit all our criteria: peer reviewed
articles addressing human emotion-regulation, involving interactive technology, including user
study, identified one or more intervention mechanisms, and where the end-goal of the research
wasanemotionregulationintervention(asopposedtosay,e.g.,anemotiondetectionalgorithm)

(cf., e.g., [80]), the stage of research and resulting contribution of many of the articles focused
on early stage explorations of innovative technologies in design space, presenting user studies
onproof-of-conceptdevicestoexaminewhetheraparticularapproach/classoftechnologieswas
viable and warranted future research. Specifically, 13 articles were coded as early stage research,
focusing on the design of prototypes and formative evaluations [14, 15, 25, 47, 52, 53, 61, 72, 76,
87, 88, 107, 108]; 14 articles were coded as mid-stage research, focusing on iterative design and
evaluation of more complex and/or robust prototypes with formative or summative evaluations
[4, 5, 9, 54, 56, 64, 66, 71, 73, 74, 102–104, 106]; finally, only 9 articles were coded as late stage
researchinvolvinghi-fidelity,robustresearchsystemsthatwerereadyforwidespreaddeployment
andsummativeevaluationsinlaborfieldstudies[7,21,31,35,44,51,81,89,91].
Many of the more exploratory systems did not fully specify the assumed intervention
mechanism based on a theory-of-change (cf., [24]), i.e., outlining how the proposed design
decisionsarelikelytoleadtousers’improvedemotionregulation,withabouthalfofthesystems
being coded as including low (15 articles; [9, 14, 25, 52–54, 56, 63, 65, 72, 73, 76, 102, 106, 108])
or medium (13 articles; [7, 15, 31, 35, 47, 51, 61, 71, 74, 87, 91, 103, 107]) specificity of the
theory of change. As a result, the intervention mechanisms were categorised in terms of in-
teraction design,with most research articles focused on utilising biofeedback components (14
articles;[4,5,51,53,54,56,63,73,74,81,103,104,107,108]),physiologicalsynchronisation,i.e.,
providing users with external input that mimics their own biosignals such as “false heart-rate
feedback” (7 articles; [9, 15, 21, 35, 61, 65, 72]); reminders and recommendations of specific ER
strategies (6 articles; [25, 31, 71, 76, 89, 91]); awareness systems that help monitor and/or track
individual emotions (5 articles; [7, 44, 52, 102, 106]); and a smattering of other bespoke systems
(4 articles; [14, 47, 87, 88]). Interestingly, a unifying characteristic across all these different ap-
proacheswasthattheirintendedusecasesrarelyshowedafocusoninterventiontransferbeyond

4.3 WhichInterventionDesignComponentsareusedinEachoftheDelivery

Our next step was to identify and categorise the design components that have been used in ex-
isting work so far. The aim was to articulate the established—or at least attempted—approaches
to supporting each of the four possible delivery mechanisms (e.g., what are all the components
thathavebeenusedtosupport‘experiential’learninginpriorHCIwork?).Inparticular,eachde-
liverymechanism—didactic,experiential,offline,on-the-spot—isbrieflycharacterisedintermsof

Interaction design patterns. The two main interaction designs used across the 23 papers—real-
time tailored biofeedback and implicit target feedback—differed substantially in how, when, and
through which psychological mechanisms users’ emotion regulation was to be supported. The

Interaction design patterns. We saw three main interaction design approaches—reminder-
recommendersystems,awarenessandreflectionsupport,andcognitivemodelsdevelopment—which
differed in when, how, and what kind of information was offered to the users. First, reminder-
recommender components provide the users with in-the-moment suggestions around specific ER
strategiesthatcouldbeused[25,31,44,71,76,89].Often,theimplementationincludedproviding
step-by-stepinstructionsonhowtoenactaparticularERstrategyintheformofstaticmaterials
(i.e.,generaldescriptionofhowto‘do’cognitivereappraisalordeepbreathing,nottailoredtoany
current experience), or by providing links to external materials. For example, Smyth et. al. [89]
delivered three reminder prompts daily (e.g., ‘Recall that even a few diaphragmatic breaths can
reducestress;ifyourcurrentcontextallowsforit,take5mindfulbreaths.’)atasemi-randomtime,
through a mobile phone notification interface. Second, the awareness and reflection interaction
mechanisms do not suggest specific activities but rather rely on prompting the users to reflect
ontheircurrentemotionalstateand/orexpectthemtoanalysea(retrospective)datalogofone’s
emotional experiences [7, 44, 52, 63, 89, 102]. The reflection support is often reliant on users’
self-report through ecological momentary assessment (EMA) [7, 44, 89], or automated system

context with a therapist [51, 76], as part of embedding the psychoeducation into the interactive
experience [81, 87], or as well-selected metaphors incorporated into an interactive game [4, 5].
Specifically, these components provide in-depth explanations of how the mind transforms
informationtoarriveatbehaviour(e.g.,how,why,where,whenitisimportanttouseERskills).

How have these been used in HCI work? Offline intervention components can take a num-
ber of forms. For instance, systems including offline components can aim to elicit strong
emotions using technology to create an artificial context in which to practice ER strategies
[54,56,73,74,81,102,108].Thisispredominantlyachievedthroughtrainingcontextsinvolving

being trained (e.g., [4, 81]). In many instances the existing components predominantly rely on
forms of biofeedback, i.e. experiential components, to ‘close’ the training loop (cf., Section 4.3.1).
Alternatively,severalinterventionsuseongoingmonitoringoftrackedemotionsacrosssituations
to create an overview that is used in a training context to enable reflection on previously
unnoticed patterns, resulting in insights and an eventual increase in emotional awareness over
time([7,44,52,102]).Multiplepapersthatinvestigatemechanismsthatenableofflinetrainingalso

physiologicaldata(e.g.,[102]),user-entereddata,suchasashortmoodquestionnaire[7];and/or
a location-based emotion assessment [43] alongside various representational forms for display.

involved monitoring and tracking individuals’ emotions over time as a means to increase users’
awareness of their emotional state(s); most of this work is akin to—and likely inspired by—HCI
work on personal informatics systems (cf., [30]). In contrast, the systems relying on reminders
or recommenders provided the users with on-the-spot suggestions of specific ER strategies to
use[25, 31, 44, 71, 76, 89]. Conceptually, thesesystems often draw on behaviouralchange inter-
vention systems, especially the Just-in-time-adaptive-intervention literature (see e.g., [69] for a

sustainabilityofeffectivesystems.Lackoftransfer-enablingsupportin-situisoneofthekeygaps
inexistingnon-technologicalinterventions(cf.,Section2).However,asdiscussedinSection4.2,
less than 15% of interventionswere specifically designed to reduce end-user dependenceon the

We expect the questions around supporting transfer and skills development will be a highly

ponents(suchascognitiverestructuring)withexperientialapproaches(suchason-the-spotexpe-
rientialsupport)arelikelytoleadtoincreasedtransfereffects.
5.1.2 Uneven Support for ER Strategies. As outlined in Section 4, the support for individual
ER strategies (situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive
change, response modulation) is not evenly distributed: across all delivery mechanisms, most
of the interactive components are targeting response modulation strategies (although these are
theoretically known to be less effective in the long term), with other well-established strategies
suchascognitivereappraisal orattentionaldeployment virtuallyunsupported.Thisisparticularly
pertinent for on-the-spot and experiential components, and the reliance on simple reminders
and/or non-technological module delivery in others. We also note that recent work suggests
that digital technologies are already often used by participants for situation selection as part of
everydayuse(cf.,[101]),buttheseapproachesareyetunder-representedintheinterventionswe
seeinourstudysample.AsimilarpictureemergeswiththestagesoftheERprocess(identification,

remainunsupported.
5.1.3 LackofEfficacyDataon(Multi-)ComponentSystems. Todate,thereisalackofdataabout

RCTs[81,104].Instead,themethodologiesreliedonobservational(e.g.,[54,56])orvariousforms
ofcomparativedesigns(e.g.,[89,103,103]).
More broadly, moving from innovation to efficacy testing is a common challenge across HCI
research (cf., [80]), with a combination of two systemic factors seemingly at play: first is the
difficulty—andcost—ofresourcingafulldevelopmentfrominceptiontoprototypestorobust,large
scaledeploymentsthatwouldbenecessaryfortestingefficacy.Second,giventhepremiumvalue
placedoninnovationandquickpublicationcycles,HCIresearchersareperhapslessmotivatedto

commonforstudiestotake2-3yearsbeforeanydataiswrittenup)andoftencanstruggletoreceive
fundingtoso(assuchstudiesmightbetoo‘mundane’fortechnologyfunderswhilebeingandtoo
‘risky’andun-tetheredforpsychology).However,asHCImovesintotheclinicalandhealthspace,
there is a need to address these issues on both practical and systemic levels – see [22] and [12]
foranalogousargumentsintechnology-enabled(mental)healthinterventionsmorebroadly,and
thesuggestedopportunitiesforresearchintheemotionalregulationinterventionspaceoutlined
inSection5.3below.
Wenotethatfocusonearlysystemevaluationthroughcollectingprocessmeasures isonepos-
sible approach that can practically address some of the challenges above while fitting into rela-
tively traditional HCI deployment studies. One of the benefits of including process measures is
thattheycanbeusedtoassessthevalidityofthetheoryofchangeandrelatedlogicmodelinearly

In what follows, we again highlight what we see as the most interesting questions, separated

6 CONCLUSIONS
The main aim of this work is to help combine innovative HCI intervention approaches with
substantial knowledge about the fundamental emotion regulation models from psychology. The
proposedframeworkisthenawayofsynthesisingthekeyaspects:encapsulatingthepsychology
fundamentals (theory component, Section 2); articulating plausible technology-enabled delivery
mechanismsthatcouldbesupportedbyinnovativetechnologies(strategiccomponent,Section3),
as well as the understanding of what has been done so far within HCI (practical component,
Section 4). Finally, Section 5 highlights how such considerations can also help shape future
researchattheintersectionoftheHCIandpsychologyfields.
Overall, it is our hope that the HCI research community can draw on the three parts of the
framework—theory, strategic, practical—and the associated research agenda to support research
at differing scale of granularity: from helping guide the overall research field as well as individ-
ual research programmes, to supporting specific design projects. On the research field level, the
framework aims to provide a common language and conceptual structure to connect research

Ontheindividualresearchprogrammelevel,weexpectthatindividualresearchersmightmost
benefitfromthepracticalframeworkcomponenttohelpidentifyanyremaininggapsinexisting

enabledsupportforcognitivereappraisal(e.g.,incontrasttoresponsemodulation),andisinter-
estedinunderstandingwhether/howsuchinterventionscouldbedevelopedinVR(whichisalso
missingfromexistingliteratureandthePIhasexpertisein).

mechanisms from a game-based prior work) and emotional narrative experiences (also a

studies. While the results of many of these studies were largely positive, the measures
used typically focused on end-users’ ability to use and understand the systems involved
in interventions, rather than evaluating changes in skills development around ER. Most
evaluations resulted in findings related to the need to change aspects of the design of the
intervention.

Some interventions explicitly provided support to end-users to learn how to modify regu-
latory responses (e.g., [4, 5, 51], but most relied on user’s ability to interpret visual forms
of feedback and use that to regulate mental or emotional states. For example, in biofeed-
back video games, bio-data impacts game mechanics that are communicated to the player
throughdynamicvisualrepresentations(e.g.,[56,81,103]).Otherbiofeedbacksystemsuse

representationstopromptatargetbreathorheartrate(e.g.,whiledriving[9,72],through
a smartwatch [15, 21] or wearable custom device [61]). Overall, this research area is still
in early stages in terms of design choices that might effectively duplicate human-human
physiological synchronization as a means to support ER. And, as Choi and Ishii point
out, the success of this approach may depends on the individual’s level of sensitivity of
interoceptiveawarenessoftheirowninternalbodystatesrelatedtomotionandstress[15].
In addition, although this approach could result in automatic down-regulation of stress
through heart or breath rates, the approach does not posit a mechanism for the explicit

In terms of mapping intervention systems onto the intervention targets within the Process
Model of ER, the aware&reflect systems are primarily targeting a combination of self-awareness
and potentially situation selection components: e.g., noticing a pattern of negative emotion in a
particular situation is assumed to lead to the participant being less likely to engage with simi-
lar situations in future iterations. The recommender systems show a broader range of potential
intervention targets that are recommended and many refer to content from traditional talking
therapies:fromsituationselection(e.g.,“goforarun!”)tocognitivechange(e.g.,“trytoreappraise
youremotions”)toresponsemodulation(e.g.,“watchafunnyvideo”).However,thisbreadthalso
means that many potentially useful strategies are covered without sufficient depth, especially if
